function results(ss_list,data_dir,run_list,output_dir)

%read in ss list, rand list, and run list

% Loop over subject, run and fold to generate figures and accuracy measure

    %the plots are always based on fold-1 to give a general idea on how the
    %GLM did over the entire search range

    %the accuracy is pulled out from the highest fold to have the highest
    %potential temporal resolution

% generate some plots
