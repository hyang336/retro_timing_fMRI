Initial idea was to define the ROI and run the convolution on HCP surface. However, since the GLM was run in volumetric space, transfer it to the HCP surface requires two resampling steps: once from volume to freesurfer surface, then another from freesurfer to HCP surface. I would like to minimize the number of resampling steps as every step introduce irreversible changes to the data which may hinder our ability to recover the timing info.

So now the idea is to use 3D conv instead of graph-based conv (as would be needed for surface data) directly on the volumetric output of the GLM.
